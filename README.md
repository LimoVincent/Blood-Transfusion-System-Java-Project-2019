<h1>#Blood-Transfusion-Management-System-Java-Project-2019</h1>

<i>This is not the best Java project in the whole world but the best (as far as java goes)  for me!!

<h2>A.	How it works:</h2>

1.	This is a very simple java program that allows one to add, delete, and update information on users of the system, blood donors and patients who are the recipients.
2.	Only those individuals(users) who have the required login credential can login and new users can sign up. Users can directly add new users.
3.	Most importantly the program can find compatible donor who is willing to give blood and check whether its blood is compatible (No agglutination) for the mentioned patient. So doctors can know the information of all available donors and call/visit or if the blood is already at the hospital they can just donate!!! Sounds cool
4.	In my humble opinion, this is a life saver :).
5.	During free time all users have full access to calculator and math game.

<h2>B.	Requirements – Development environment</h2>

1.	I used SQLite database, so your PC should have latest SQLite, or a similar database management installed. 
2.	Change the path of the database file in   JavaConnect.java from "jdbc:sqlite:C:\\Users\\Vincent Limo\\Desktop\\Vincent_Blood\\Vincent_Limo_Blood\\Filelocation2.sqlite");
3.	to the path of this project in your PC.
4.	I've also realized that the project doesn’t run in other PCs unless;
a)	JTattoo-1.6.11  (jar file for excellent user interface) and/or
b)	sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2 (Java Database Connectivity Driver) and/or
c)	rs2xml  (Commons (DbUtils) or none. You can download  from https://bit.ly/2RAEIZ7 , https://bit.ly/2zsvNkQ and https://bit.ly/2JAo9tq respectively and attached as ‘Add jar/Folder’ to project Library or when  'resolving' problems 
  (use FREE LOG IN IF DATABASE CONNECTIVITY IS NOT ESTABLISHED though you won't be able to manage or view data)
Note: Just so you know, I used NetBeans as a development environment
